**Welcome to the Island Counter App! 🏝️**

Hey there! Welcome to my Island Counter, where we'll explore the magic of Zustand state management coupled with React Konva to create an interactive island counter application.

**What's Inside?**

- **Zustand State Management:** Dive into the world of efficient state management with Zustand, a powerful library that makes managing state in React applications a breeze.
- **React Konva Integration:** Experience the seamless integration of React Konva, a canvas library for React, to visualize and interact with our island grid.
- **Island Counter Algorithm:** Discover the algorithmic magic behind our island counter application, where we use depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the number of connected islands in real-time.

**How to Get Started?**

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3.  Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4.  Explore the Island Counter app, toggle those cells, and dive into the world of Zustand-powered state management!

**Join the Adventure!** Ready to embark on your own state management journey? Dive into Zustand and React Konva to unleash the power of efficient, high-performance state management in your React apps. Trust me, once you go Zustand, you'll never look back! 😉

**Cheers to Pet Projects and State Management Adventures! 🎉**
